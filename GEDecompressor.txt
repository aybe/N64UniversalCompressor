Permission is granted to use and modify freely, as long as original credit is given and visible.

To use:

	GECompression compressed;
	compressed.SetGame(m_gameselection.GetCurSel());
	compressed.SetPath(directory);
	unsigned char* Buffer;
	// ...
	compressed.SetCompressedBuffer(Buffer, sizeBuffer);
	unsigned char* outputDecompressed = compressed.OutputDecompressedBuffer(fileSizeReturnSize);

	compressed.CompressGZipFile((CString)inputFile, (CString)outputFile, dobyteFlipCompressed);
